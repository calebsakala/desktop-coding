A bundle of programs created to make my daily tasks easier.


## Within:

* **WEBSITE OPENER**\
Once I open my web browser, it's easy to get distracted.

That's why I created *website-opener.ssh*:\
A bash script designed to open any valid website from the (linux) command line.

-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh google.com` will open Google.\
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh coursera.org` will open Coursera.\
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh -help` will bring up help options.


* **YOUTUBE SEARCH**\
Once I open YouTube... you guessed it! It's *easy* to get distracted.

That's why I created *youtube-search.ssh*:\
A bash script designed to perform any valid YouTube search from the (linux) command line.

-> Calling `./youtube-search.ssh Learning Bash is Fun` will search 'Learning Bash is Fun' on YouTube.\
-> Calling `./youtube-search.ssh 312389.sahuif4` will search '312389.sahuif4' on YouTube (literally a random combination of characters).\
-> Calling `./youtube-search.ssh -help` will bring up help options.\
-> In the incredibly unlikely event that your search leads to an invalid page, the program will let you know.

-> Protip: creating an alias in your /.bashrc file makes running each program a whole lot easier. ;)
