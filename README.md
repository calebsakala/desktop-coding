A bundle of programs created to make my daily tasks easier.


## Within:

* WEBSITE OPENER\
Once I open my web browser, it's easy to get distracted.

That's why I created *website-opener.ssh*:\
A bash script designed to open any valid website from the (linux) command line.

-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh google.com` will open Google.\
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh coursera.org` will open Coursera.\
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh -help` will bring up help options.
