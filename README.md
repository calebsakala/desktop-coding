A bundle of programs created to make my daily tasks easier.


## Within:

* WEBSITE OPENER\
Once I open my web browser, it's easy to get distracted.< br />< br />

That's why I created 'website-opener.ssh':\n
A bash script designed to open any valid website from the (Linux) command line.\n\n

-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh google.com` will open Google.\n
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh coursera.org` will open Coursera.\n
-> Calling `./website-opener.ssh -help` will bring up help options.\n
